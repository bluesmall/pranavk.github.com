I am a passionate computer science student, currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or I should say currently playing my computer science bachelor's degree. Yep, I define that activity as 'playing' whenever I need to express that it is giving me a joy. Infact alot of us does that. So, I do play Computer science.

## About the Website

Its good to have one website hosted on public servers. And if you have no business to do over the internet, so you can have blog which expose your life to
the outside world.

The website if made by using jekyll and some of the tweaking that I did with it. I love it. You can read my post about starting with jekyll in the blog archive if you are interested in creating such a website I have created, it takes no more than a day to fully 
setup your jekyll website and I really like it. 

Well in this website I have thought of putting as much as entries as possible. Everyday I learn something new, so why not share all these learnings with you. There
are small learnings also sometimes, small enough which makes them ineligible to share on the internet. But whenever I learn something new in this beautiful world of
**Computer Science** and I feel like sharing it, I just add a new entry in my blog.
